# What is this?

This py file is the reason I started thinking about using GitHub. Took years to come around putting it here, I think this is the 15th version of the file I found in my HD. Never mind, doesn't matter.

Here you will find a collection of some useful things I have (poorly) written myself or obtained from others (attributed).

Mostly small stuff, useful for image analysis.
